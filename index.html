            <h2>We are glad to see you here!</h2>
            <hr>
            <h4>This is why we started</h4>
            <p>Here at KarloDesign, we create remarkable websites for either your personal or small business. If you simply want a portfolio or resume for yourself, a small website to show off your items for sale, or maybe a site to show off your photography pictures... We are here to help. Unlike most CMS-based developers or web development services, we are here for you. Our personal web developers are here to ensure updates go smoothly. Here, you don't have to worry on what your site should look like or even the need of trying to code/program your site. Simply let us know whether you want something updates or added to your site and we'll modify your site as soon as possible. Already have a site? Don't worry. We can help modify your site as webmasters to ensure quality and update checks are going under plan.</p>
            <h4>We're out of the ordinary</h4>
            <p>When was the last time you've ever seen a website with Comic Sans? Have you ever seen a website with easter eggs and flashing colors anymore? It's probably no. Here at KarloDesign, we go out of the ordinary. We provide you with creative solutions instead of just a blank website. Instead of using a CMS-based system and following their uses, create a website with creative and out of the ordinary features that many websites don't have</p>
            <h4>We're not selling you anything. Only the things you need. That's it!</h4>
            <p>Why would we lose the trust of the client. Yes, we call you client. KarloDesign never sells you anything you don't need. Here, you're never the customer. We believe that word means a person that buys things and spends things. Clients have everlasting relationships with the business and you. Even if you are simply creating a website for your portfolio, we will still call you a client. If you contact our customer service, we won't try to persuade you with a new plan or package. Only if you ask.</p>
            <h4>It's your choice. Think about it.</h4>
            <p>We know that as the customer, it's your job to determine which service to choose. You can contact us and ask us about what we do differently than other web development services. We'll give you our side of the story. But, we won't try to pressure you on anything. You are never pressured on making a decision here at KarloDesign. It's your choice on choosing which web development service to use. Don't worry, we will not be upset :).</p>

            <p>* We use GitHub as our website hosting provider. Depending on your plan, your repository may/will be public but shouldn't affect your website performance in any way. A repository is a place that your website files will be located thru GitHub. This means your site's files and information will be made public. This isn't something to be worried about though as many websites already make their repository public to all. There isn't much of a feature to remove this but this shouldn't affect your performance of your website in any way.</p>
            <p>* We are not an ICANN accredited business. We purchase your domain at an ICANN accredited business like Google Domains. This is also how we offer Email Forwarding for free thanks to Google Domains. Your website, if choosing Web Development and Publishing, will transfer full ownership to your own use if you wish. If you choose to continue using KarloDesign, your website files will be monitored and updated until your plan's expiry date. If you choose to stop using KarloDesign during your plan, you will not receive any reimbursement and your plan will end. Your website files will be provided to you and domain ownership and repository ownership.</p>
            <p>* You cannot refund your payment after your purchase a plan or package. After receiving your funds, we will complete the tasks necessary and continuously assist you depending on your plan or package.</p>
