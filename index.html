            <p>* We use GitHub as our website hosting provider. Depending on your plan, your repository may/will be public but shouldn't affect your website performance in any way. A repository is a place that your website files will be located thru GitHub. This means your site's files and information will be made public. This isn't something to be worried about though as many websites already make their repository public to all. There isn't much of a feature to remove this but this shouldn't affect your performance of your website in any way.</p>
            <p>* We are not an ICANN accredited business. We purchase your domain at an ICANN accredited business like Google Domains. This is also how we offer Email Forwarding for free thanks to Google Domains. Your website, if choosing Web Development and Publishing, will transfer full ownership to your own use if you wish. If you choose to continue using KarloDesign, your website files will be monitored and updated until your plan's expiry date. If you choose to stop using KarloDesign during your plan, you will not receive any reimbursement and your plan will end. Your website files will be provided to you and domain ownership and repository ownership.</p>
            <p>* You cannot refund your payment after your purchase a plan or package. After receiving your funds, we will complete the tasks necessary and continuously assist you depending on your plan or package.</p>
            <p>* KarloDesign Web Development Services offers organization packages for non-profit organizations. Please inquire regarding this. You will need to prove your status as a non-profit organization. This may include as a document from your state's local government or a tax document. We are only providing this service to US-based organizations. Some exceptions may be applied if your organization is based in Canada.</p>
